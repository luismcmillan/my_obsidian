- In Java, applications are both compiled and interpreted
	- **The Java compiler compiles your application source code to an intermediate language (bytecode) that is interpreted by the JVM.**
	- **Bytecode is NOT machine code that gets executed directly**
	- **Instead, the JVM translates (i.e. interprets) the bytecode into machine code, which gets run by the actual platform**
- In other words, bytecode is like the "machine code" for the JVM
	- **the bytecode is platform independent and can therefor be interpreted by any JVM**
	- **JVM are build specific to particular platforms (hardware and OS)**
