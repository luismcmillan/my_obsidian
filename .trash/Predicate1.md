- Java includes a [[Functional Interface]] called "Predicate" to handle a very common scenario: a "test" method is invoked with a parameter, **resulting in a boolean outcome**
	-The type is Predicate<> where "T" can be any type needed in the test
	-It's single abstract method is **boolean test(T t)*
