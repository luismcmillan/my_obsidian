- [[Amazon S3]]
- Objects (files) have a Key
- The **key** is the FULL path:
	- s3://my-bucket/**my_file.txt**
- The key is composed of prefix + object name
	- s3://my-bucket/**my_folder/another_filder**/my_file.txt
- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes("/")
