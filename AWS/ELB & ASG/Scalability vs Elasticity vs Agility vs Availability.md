- **Scalability**: ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware stringer (scale up), or adding nodes (scale out)
- **Elasticity**: once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some "auto-scaling" so that the system can scale based on the load. This is "cloud-friendly": pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs [[Auto Scaling Group]]
- **Agility**: new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes
- **Availability**: Having applications across multible AZ.
