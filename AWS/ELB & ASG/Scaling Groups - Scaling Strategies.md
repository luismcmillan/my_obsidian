- [[Auto Scaling Group]]
- Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually
- Dynamic Scaling: Respond to chaning demand
	- Simple/Step Scaling
		- When CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
		- When CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
	- Target Tracking scaling
		- I want the average ASG CPU to stay around 40%
	- Scheduled Scaling
		- Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
		- Example: increase the min. capacity to 10 at 5 pm on Fridays
	- Predictive Scaling
		- Uses Machine Learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
		- Automatically provisions the right number of EC2 instances in advance
