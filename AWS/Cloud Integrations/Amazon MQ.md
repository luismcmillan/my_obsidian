- [[SQS - Simple Queue Service]], [[Amazon SNS - Simple Notification Service]] are cloud native services
- Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- **When migrating to the cloud**, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
- managed by
	- RabbitMQ
	- ActiveMQ
- Amazon MQ doesn't "scale" as much as SQS / SNS
- Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)
