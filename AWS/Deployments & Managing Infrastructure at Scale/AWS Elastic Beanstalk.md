- [[Deployment - Summary]]
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- **free to use**
- You only manage data and applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it even easier for developers to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud
- Uses all components:
	- [[EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud]], [[Auto Scaling Group]], ELB, [[Amazon RDS]], etc...
- But it's all in one view that's easy to make sense of
- We still have full control over the configuration
- **Beanstalk = Platform as a Service**
- Managed service
	- instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk
	- Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic beanstalk
	- Capacity provisioning
	- Load balancing & auto-scaling
	- Application health-monitoring & responsiveness
- **Just application code is the responsibility of the developer**

- Three architecture models:
	- Single Instance deployment: good for dev
	- LB + ASG: great for production
	- ASG only: great for non-web apps in production
